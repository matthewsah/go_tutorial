A module is a releasable collections of go packages that are released together

it is common for a reposirtory to have a single module in it

The module path is the import path prefix for all packages within the module

ex:

module github.com/project/welcomePage
go 1.20
require github.com/google/examplePackage v1.2.4

No central location for third party packages, uses import path as remote url

to download the module golang.orgs/x/tools, go downloads the file from https://golang.org/x/tools
